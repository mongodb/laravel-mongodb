Overview
--------

When you use a relational database, the Eloquent ORM stores models as rows
in tables that correspond to the model classes.  When you use MongoDB, the
{+odm-short+} stores models as documents in collections that correspond to the
model classes.

To define a relationship, add a function to the model class that calls the
appropriate relationship method. This function allows you to access the related
model as a **dynamic property**. A dynamic property lets you access the
related model by using the same syntax as you use to access a property on the
model.

This page describes the following Laravel Eloquent and MongoDB-specific
relationships available in {+odm-short+} and shows examples of how to define
and use them:

- :ref:`One to one relationship <laravel-eloquent-relationship-one-to-one>`,
  created by using the ``hasOne()`` method and its inverse, ``belongsTo()``
- :ref:`One to many relationship <laravel-eloquent-relationship-one-to-many>`,
  created by using the ``hasMany()`` and its inverse, ``belongsTo()``
- :ref:`Many to many relationship <laravel-eloquent-relationship-many-to-many>`,
  created by using the ``belongsToMany()`` method
- :ref:`Embedded document pattern <laravel-embedded-document-pattern>`, a
  MongoDB-specific relationship that can represent a one to one or one to many
  relationship, created by using the ``embedsOne()`` or ``embedsMany()`` method
- :ref:`Cross-database relationships <laravel-relationship-cross-database>`,
  required when you want to create relationships between MongoDB and SQL models

.. _laravel-eloquent-relationship-one-to-one:

One to One Relationship
-----------------------

A one to one relationship between models consists of a model record related to
exactly one other type of model record.

When you add a one to one relationship, Eloquent lets you access the model by
using a dynamic property and stores the model's document ID on the related
model.

In {+odm-short+}, you can define a one to one relationship by using the
``hasOne()`` method or ``belongsTo()`` method.

When you add the inverse of the relationship by using the ``belongsTo()``
method, Eloquent lets you access the model by using a dynamic property, but
does not add any fields.

To learn more about one to one relationships, see
`One to One <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent-relationships#one-to-one>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

One to One Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example class shows how to define a ``HasOne`` one to one
relationship between a ``Planet`` and ``Orbit`` model.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/PlanetOneToOne.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The following example class shows how to define the inverse relationship with
``Orbit`` by using the  ``belongsTo()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/OrbitOneToOne.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The following sample code shows how to instantiate a model for each class
and add the relationship between them. Click the :guilabel:`View Output`

      :visible: false

      // Document in the "planets" collection
      {
        _id: ObjectId('65de67fb2e59d63e6d07f8b8'),
        name: 'Earth',
        diameter_km: 12742,
        // ...
      }

      // Document in the "orbits" collection

   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin planet orbit dynamic property example
   :end-before: end planet orbit dynamic property example

.. _laravel-eloquent-relationship-one-to-many:

One to Many Relationship
------------------------

A one to many relationship between models consists of a model that is
the parent and one or more related child model records.

When you add a one to many relationship method, Eloquent lets you access the
model by using a dynamic property and stores the parent model's document ID
on each of the child model documents.

In {+odm-short+}, you can define a one to many relationship by using the
``hasMany()`` method on the parent class and, optionally, the ``belongsTo()``
method on the child class.

When you add the inverse of the relationship by using the ``belongsTo()``
method, Eloquent lets you access the parent model by using a dynamic property
without adding any fields.

To learn more about one to many relationships, see
`One to Many <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent-relationships#one-to-many>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

One to Many Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example class shows how to define a ``HasMany`` one to many
relationship between a ``Planet`` parent model and ``Moon`` child model.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/PlanetOneToMany.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

To define the inverse of the relationship on ``Moon``, add the dynamic
property and call the ``belongsTo()`` method on it, as shown in the following
example class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/MoonOneToMany.php
   :language: php

.. _laravel-eloquent-relationship-many-to-many:

Many to Many Relationship
-------------------------

A many to many relationship consists of a relationship between two different
model types in which one type of model record can be related to multiple
records of the other type.

In {+odm-short+}, you can define a many to many relationship by adding the
``belongsToMany()`` method to both related classes.

When you define a many to many relationship in a relational database, Laravel
creates a pivot table to track the relationships. When you use {+odm-short+},
it omits the pivot table creation and adds the related document IDs to a
document field, derived from the related model class name.

.. tip::

   Since {+odm-short+} uses a document field instead of a pivot table, omit
   the pivot table parameter from the ``belongsToMany()`` constructor or set
   it to ``null``.

To learn more about many to many relationships in Laravel, see
`Many to Many <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent-relationships#many-to-many>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

The following section shows an example of how to create a many to many
relationship between model classes.

Many to Many Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following ``Planet`` class shows how to define a ``BelongsToMany`` many to
many relationship with  and a ``SpaceExplorer`` model.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/PlanetManyToMany.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The ``SpaceExplorer`` model defines a ``BelongsToMany`` many to many
relationship with ``Planet`` as shown in the following example class:

.. _laravel-embedded-document-pattern:

Embedded Document Pattern
-------------------------

In MongoDB, the embedded document pattern adds the related model's data into
the parent model instead of keeping foreign key references. Use this pattern
to meet one or more of the following requirements:

- Keeping associated data together in a single collection
- Performing atomic updates on multiple fields of the document and the associated
  data
- Reducing the number of reads required to fetch the data

In {+odm-short+}, you can define embedded documents by using one of the
following dynamic property methods:

- ``embedsOne()`` to embed a single document
- ``embedsMany()`` to embed multiple documents

.. note::

   These methods return Eloquent collections, which differ from query builder
   objects.

To learn more about the MongoDB embedded document pattern, see the following
MongoDB server tutorials:

- :manual:`Model One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents </tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-one-relationships-between-documents/>`
- :manual:`Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents </tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/>`

The following section shows an example of how to use the embedded document
pattern.

Embedded Document Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example class shows how to define an ``embedsMany`` one to many
relationship between a ``SpaceShip`` and ``Cargo`` model:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/SpaceShipEmbedsMany.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The embedded model class omits the relationship definition as shown in the
following example class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/CargoEmbedsMany.php

           }
         ]
      }

.. _laravel-relationship-cross-database:

Cross-Database Relationships
----------------------------

A cross-database relationship in {+odm-short+} is a relationship between models
stored in a SQL relational database and models stored in a MongoDB database.

When you add a cross-database relationship, Eloquent lets you access a
related model by using a dynamic property.

{+odm-short+} supports the following cross-database relationship methods:

- ``hasOne()``
- ``hasMany()``
- ``belongsTo()``

To define a cross-database relationship, you must import the
``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\HybridRelations`` package in the class stored in
the relational database.

The following section shows an example of how to define a cross-database
relationship.

Cross-Database Relationship Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example class creates a ``hasMany`` relationship between a
``SpaceShip`` model stored in a MySQL database and a ``Passenger`` model
stored in a MongoDB database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/SpaceShipCrossHasMany.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The ``Passenger`` model defines a ``BelongsToMany`` relationship with
``SpaceShip`` as shown in the following example class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/relationships/PassengerCrossBelongsTo.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

The following sample code shows how to create a ``SpaceShip`` model in
a MySQL database and related ``Passenger`` models in a MongoDB database and
