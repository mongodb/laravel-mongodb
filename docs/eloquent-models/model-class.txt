Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+odm-long+} to define and
customize Laravel Eloquent models. You can use these models to work with
MongoDB data by using the Laravel Eloquent object-relational mapper (ORM).

The following sections explain how to add Laravel Eloquent ORM behaviors
to {+odm-short+} models:

- :ref:`laravel-model-define` demonstrates how to create a model class.
- :ref:`laravel-authenticatable-model` shows how to set MongoDB as the
  authentication user provider.
- :ref:`laravel-model-customize` explains several model class customizations.
- :ref:`laravel-model-pruning` shows how to periodically remove models that
  you no longer need.

.. _laravel-model-define:

Define an Eloquent Model Class
------------------------------

Eloquent models are classes that represent your data. They include methods
that perform database operations such as inserts, updates, and deletes.

To declare a {+odm-short+} model class, create a file in your Laravel
application ``app/Models`` directory. Add the import for the
``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model`` package and extend the ``Model`` class as
shown in the following code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/Planet.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

Alternatively, use the ``artisan`` console to generate the model class and
change the ``Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`` import to ``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model``.
To learn more about the ``artisan`` console, see `Artisan Console <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/artisan>`__
in the Laravel docs.

.. _laravel-authenticatable-model:

Extend the Authenticatable Model
--------------------------------

To configure MongoDB as the Laravel user provider, you can extend the
{+odm-short+} ``MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User`` class. The following code example
shows how to extend this class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/AuthenticatableUser.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

To learn more about customizing a Laravel authentication user provider,
see `Adding Custom User Providers <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/authentication#adding-custom-user-providers>`__
in the Laravel docs.

.. _laravel-model-customize:

Customize an Eloquent Model Class
---------------------------------

This section shows how to perform the following Eloquent model behavior
customizations:

- :ref:`laravel-model-customize-collection-name`
- :ref:`laravel-model-customize-primary-key`
- :ref:`laravel-model-soft-delete`
- :ref:`laravel-model-cast-data-types`
- :ref:`laravel-model-mass-assignment`

.. _laravel-model-customize-collection-name:

Change the Model Collection Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To customize the name of the collection the model uses to retrieve and save
data in MongoDB, override the ``$collection`` property of the model
class.

By default, the model uses the MongoDB database name set in your Laravel
application's ``config/database.php`` setting and the snake case plural form of
your model class name for the collection.

The following example specifies the custom MongoDB collection name,
``celestial_body``, for the ``Planet`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetCollection.php
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 9
   :dedent:

.. _laravel-model-customize-primary-key:

Change the Primary Key Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To customize the model's primary key field that uniquely identify a MongoDB
document, override the ``$primaryKey`` property of the model class.

By default, the model uses the PHP MongoDB driver to generate unique IDs for
each document your Laravel application inserts.

The following example specifies the ``name`` field as the primary key for
the ``Planet`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetPrimaryKey.php
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 9
   :dedent:

To learn more about primary key behavior and customization options, see
`Eloquent Primary Keys <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent#primary-keys>`__
in the Laravel docs.

To learn more about the ``_id`` field and the MongoDB document structure, see
:manual:`Documents </core/document>` in the MongoDB server docs.

.. _laravel-model-soft-delete:

Enable Soft Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eloquent includes a soft delete feature that changes the behavior of the
``delete()`` method on a model. When soft delete is enabled on a model, the
``delete()`` method marks a document as deleted instead of removing it from the
database.  It sets a timestamp on the ``deleted_at`` field to exclude it from
retrieve operations automatically.

To enable soft deletes on a class, import the ``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\SoftDeletes``
package and add the trait to the class definition as shown in the following
code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetSoftDelete.php
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 6,10
   :dedent:

To learn about methods you can perform on models with soft deletes enabled, see
`Eloquent Soft Deleting <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent#soft-deleting>`__
in the Laravel docs.

.. _laravel-model-cast-data-types:

Cast Data Types
---------------

Eloquent lets you convert model attribute data types before storing or
retrieving data by using a casting helper. This helper is a convenient
alternative to defining equivalent accessor and mutator methods on your model.

In the following example, the casting helper converts the ``discovery_dt``
model attribute, stored in MongoDB as a `MongoDB\\BSON\\UTCDateTime <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mongodb-bson-utcdatetime.php>`__
type, to the Laravel ``datetime`` type.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetDate.php
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 9-11
   :dedent:

This conversion lets you use the PHP `DateTime <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php>`__
or the `Carbon class <https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/>`__ to work with dates
in this field. The following example shows a Laravel query that uses the
casting helper on the model to query for planets with a ``discovery_dt`` of
less than three years ago:

.. code-block:: php

   Planet::where(
       'discovery_dt', '>',
       new DateTime('-3 years')
   )->get();


To learn more about MongoDB's data types, see :manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types/>`
in the MongoDB server docs.

To learn more about the Laravel casting helper and supported types, see `Attribute Casting <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting>`__
in the Laravel docs.

.. _laravel-model-mass-assignment:

Customize Mass Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eloquent lets you create several models and their attribute data by passing
an array of data to the ``create()`` model method. This process of inserting
multiple models is called mass assignment.

Mass assignment can be an efficient way to create multiple models. However, it
can be expose an exploitable security vulnerability. The data in the fields
could contain updates that could lead to unauthorized permissions or access.

Eloquent provides the following traits to protect your data from mass
assignment vulnerabilities:

- ``$fillable`` contains the fields that are writeable in a mass assignment
- ``$guarded`` contains the fields that are ignored in a mass assignment

.. important::

   We recommend using ``$fillable`` instead of ``$guarded`` to protect against
   vulnerabilities. To learn more about this recommendation, see the
   `Security Release: Laravel 6.18.35, 7.24.0 <https://blog.laravel.com/security-release-laravel-61835-7240>`__
   article on the Laravel site.

In the following example, the model allows mass assignment of the fields
by using the ``$fillable`` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetMassAssignment.php
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 14-19
   :dedent:

The following code example shows mass assignment of the ``Planet`` model:

.. code-block:: php

   $planets = [
       [ 'name' => 'Earth', gravity => 9.8, day_length => '24 hours' ],
       [ 'name' => 'Mars', gravity => 3.7, day_length => '25 hours' ],
   ];

   Planet::create($planets);

The models saved to the database contain only the ``name`` and ``gravity``
fields since ``day_length`` is omitted from the ``$fillable`` attribute.

To learn how to change the behavior when attempting to fill a field omitted
from the ``$fillable`` array, see `Mass Assignment Exceptions <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent#mass-assignment-exceptions>`__
in the Laravel docs.

.. _laravel-model-pruning:

Specify Pruning Behavior
------------------------

Eloquent lets you specify criteria to periodically delete model data that you
no longer need.  When you schedule or run the ``model:prune`` command,
Laravel calls the ``prunable()`` method on all models that import the
``Prunable`` and ``MassPrunable`` traits to match the models for deletion.

To use this feature with models that use MongoDB as a database, add the
appropriate import to your model:

- ``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Prunable`` optionally performs a cleanup
  step before deleting a model that matches the criteria
- ``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\MassPrunable`` deletes models that match the
  criteria without fetching the model data

To learn more about the pruning feature, see `Pruning Models <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent#pruning-models>`__
in the Laravel docs.

Prunable Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example model shows how to perform a prune that calls the
``pruning()`` method before deleting a model that matches the query in the
``prunable()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetPrune.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

Mass Prunable Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example model shows how to perform a "mass prune" which deletes
all models that match the query in the ``prunable()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/eloquent-models/PlanetMassPrune.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
