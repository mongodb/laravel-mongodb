Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to add the {+odm-long+} to a new Laravel web
application, connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and perform
read and write operations on the data.

.. tip::

   If you prefer to set up your development environment in GitHub Codespaces
   or Docker, see the linked code repository in the
   `How to Build a Laravel + MongoDB Back End Service <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/php/laravel-mongodb-tutorial/>`__
   MongoDB Developer Center tutorial.

   You can learn how to set up a local Laravel development environment
   and perform CRUD operations by viewing the
   :mdbu-course:`Getting Started with Laravel and MongoDB </getting-started-with-laravel-and-mongodb>`
   MongoDB University Learning Byte.

   If you prefer to connect to MongoDB by using the PHP Library driver without
   Laravel, see `Connecting to MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/connecting/>`__
   in the PHP Library documentation.

{+odm-short+} extends the Laravel Eloquent and Query Builder syntax to
store and retrieve data from MongoDB.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to create a sample Laravel web application
that connects to a MongoDB deployment.

.. tip::

   You can download the complete web application project by cloning the
   `laravel-quickstart <https://github.com/mongodb-university/laravel-quickstart>`__
   GitHub repository.
