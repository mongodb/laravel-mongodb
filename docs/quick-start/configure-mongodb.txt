   :keywords: test connection, runnable, code example

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Configure the application environment variable file

      Copy the ``.env.example`` file to a file named ``.env`` in the project
      root directory by running the following shell command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         cp .env.example .env

      Open the ``.env`` file and add or edit the following variables and values.
      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with your connection
      string from the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-connection-string` step:

      .. code-block:: bash

         DB_CONNECTION=mongodb
         DB_URI="<connection string>"

      For example, if your connection string is
      ``"mongodb+srv://myUser:myPass123@mongo0.example.com/"``,
      your ``DB_URI`` variable matches the following line:

      .. code-block:: bash

         DB_URI="mongodb+srv://myUser:myPass123@mongo0.example.com/"

      .. note::

         Make sure these variables in your ``.env`` file are undefined in the
         shell in which you run your application. Environment variables in
         the shell take precedence over the ones in the ``.env`` file.

   .. step:: Set the connection string in the database configuration

      Open the ``database.php`` file in the ``config`` directory and set the
      default database connection to the ``DB_CONNECTION`` environment
      variable as shown in the following line:

      .. code-block:: php

         'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION'),

      Add the following highlighted ``mongodb`` entry to the ``connections`` array
      in the same file:

      .. code-block:: php
         :emphasize-lines: 2-6

         'connections' => [
           'mongodb' => [
             'driver' => 'mongodb',
             'dsn' => env('DB_URI'),
             'database' => 'sample_mflix',
           ],

         // ...

   .. step:: Add the {+odm-short+} provider

      Open the ``providers.php`` file in the ``bootstrap`` directory and add
      the following entry into the array:

      .. code-block::

         MongoDB\Laravel\MongoDBServiceProvider::class,

      .. tip::

         To learn how to register the provider in Laravel 10.x, see
         `Registering Providers <https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/providers#registering-providers>`__.

After completing these steps, your Laravel web application is ready to
connect to MongoDB.
