You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

      Complete the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?tck=docs_driver_laravel>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a new free
      tier MongoDB deployment.

   .. step:: Save your Credentials
