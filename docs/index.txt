Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+odm-long+}.
This package extends methods in the PHP Laravel API to work with MongoDB as
a datastore in your Laravel application. {+odm-short+} allows you to use
Laravel Eloquent and Query Builder syntax to work with your MongoDB data.

.. note::

   This documentation describes the ``mongodb/laravel-mongodb`` package,
   formerly named ``jenssegers/mongodb``. This package is now owned and
   maintained by MongoDB, Inc. and is compatible with Laravel 10.x and
   later.

   To find versions of the package compatible with older versions of Laravel,
   see `Laravel Version Compatibility <https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/blob/3.9/README.md#installation>`__
   on GitHub.
