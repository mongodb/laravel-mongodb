Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+odm-short+} extension of
the Laravel query builder to work with a MongoDB database. The query builder
lets you use a single syntax and fluent interface to write queries for any
supported database.

.. note::

   {+odm-short+} extends Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM, which can
   run similar database operations. To learn more about retrieving documents
   by using Eloquent models, see :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-retrieve`.

Laravel provides a **facade** to access the query builder class ``DB``, which
lets you perform database operations. Facades, which are static interfaces to
classes, make the syntax more concise, avoid runtime errors, and improve
testability.

{+odm-short+} aliases the ``DB`` method ``table()`` as the ``collection()``
method. Chain methods to specify commands and any constraints. Then, chain
the ``get()`` method at the end to run the methods and retrieve the results.
The following example shows the syntax of a query builder call:

.. code-block:: php

   DB::collection('<collection name>')
       // chain methods by using the "->" object operator
       ->get();
.. tip::

   Before using the ``DB::collection()`` method, ensure that you specify MongoDB as your application's
   default database connection. For instructions on setting the database connection,
   see the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-connect-to-mongodb` step in the Quick Start.

   If MongoDB is not your application's default database, you can use the ``DB::connection()`` method
   to specify a MongoDB connection. Pass the name of the connection to the ``connection()`` method,
   as shown in the following code:
   
   .. code-block:: php
   
      $connection = DB::connection('mongodb');

This guide provides examples of the following types of query builder operations:

- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-query-builder`
- :ref:`laravel-modify-results-query-builder`
- :ref:`laravel-mongodb-read-query-builder`
- :ref:`laravel-mongodb-write-query-builder`

Before You Get Started
----------------------

To run the code examples in this guide, complete the
:ref:`Quick Start <laravel-quick-start>` tutorial to configure a web
application, load sample datasets into your MongoDB deployment, and
run the example code from a controller method. To see the expected code
output as JSON documents, use the ``toJson()`` method shown in the optional
:ref:`View your results as JSON documents <laravel-quick-start-json>` step
of the Quick Start.

To perform read and write operations by using the query builder, import the
``Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB`` facade and compose your query.

.. _laravel-retrieve-query-builder:

builder method to retrieve documents from the ``movies`` collection
that contain an ``imdb.rating`` field value of exactly ``9.3``. Click the
:guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the results returned

            ...
         }
      ]

.. _laravel-query-builder-logical-operations:

Logical Conditional Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section show the query builder syntax you
can use to perform the following logical conditional operations:

- :ref:`Logical OR to match one or more conditions <laravel-query-builder-logical-or>`
- :ref:`Logical AND to match all conditions <laravel-query-builder-logical-and>`
- :ref:`Logical NOT to match the negation of the condition <laravel-query-builder-logical-not>`
- :ref:`Nested logical operator groups <laravel-query-builder-logical-nested>`

.. _laravel-query-builder-logical-or:

Logical OR Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to chain the ``orWhere()``
query builder method to retrieve documents from the
``movies`` collection that either match the ``_id``
value of ``ObjectId('573a1398f29313caabce9682')`` or match
the ``title`` value ``"Back to the Future"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin query orWhere
   :end-before: end query orWhere

.. note::

   Beginning in {+odm-short+} v4.6, you can use the ``id`` alias to
   represent the ``_id`` field, as shown in the preceding code. When you
   run a find operation using the query builder, {+odm-short+}
   automatically converts between ``id`` and ``_id``.

.. _laravel-query-builder-logical-and:

Logical AND Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to chain the ``where()``
query builder method to retrieve documents from the
``movies`` collection that match both an ``imdb.rating``
value greater than ``8.5`` and a ``year`` value of less than
``1940``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin query andWhere
   :end-before: end query andWhere

.. _laravel-query-builder-logical-not:

Logical NOT Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to call the ``whereNot()``
query builder method to retrieve documents from the
``movies`` collection that match documents that do not have an ``imdb.rating``
value greater than ``2``. This is equivalent to matching all documents
that have an ``imdb.rating`` of less than or equal to ``2``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin query whereNot
   :end-before: end query whereNot

.. _laravel-query-builder-logical-nested:

Nested Logical Operator Group Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to chain the ``where()``
query builder method to retrieve documents from the
``movies`` collection that match both of the following
conditions. This example passes a closure as the first
parameter of the ``where()`` query builder method to group
the logical OR group:

- ``imdb.rating`` value is greater than ``8.5``
- ``year`` value is either ``1986`` or ``1996``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin query nestedLogical
   :end-before: end query nestedLogical

.. _laravel-query-builder-range-type:

Ranges and Type Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section show the query builder syntax you can use to
match values by using the following range queries and type check operations:

- :ref:`Null or missing values <laravel-query-builder-null>`
- :ref:`One or more values of a set <laravel-query-builder-wherein>`

   .. input:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin query whereBetween
      :end-before: end query whereBetween

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      [
         { "title" "The Godfather", "imdb": { "rating": 9.2, "votes": 1038358, "id": 68646 }, ... },

with the ``where()`` query builder method to retrieve documents from the
``movies`` collection by using a specified text pattern.

Text patterns can contain text mixed with the following
wildcard characters:

- ``%`` which matches zero or more characters
- ``_`` which matches a single character

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/query-builder/QueryBuilderTest.php

         { "title": "Spider-Man", ... },
         { "title": "Spider-Man 2", ...},
         ...
      ]

.. _laravel-query-builder-distinct:

.. _laravel-query-builder-aggregation-groupby:

Results Grouped by Common Field Values Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to use the ``groupBy()`` query builder method
to retrieve document data grouped by shared values of the ``runtime`` field.
This example chains the following operations to match documents from the
``movies`` collection that contain a ``rated`` value of ``G`` and include the
``title`` field of one movie for each distinct ``runtime`` value:

- Match only documents that contain a ``rated`` field value of ``"G"`` by
  using the ``where()`` method
- Group data by the distinct values of the ``runtime`` field, which is
  assigned the ``_id`` field, by using the ``groupBy()`` method
- Sort the groups by the ``runtime`` field by using the ``orderBy()`` method
- Return ``title`` data from the last document in the grouped result by
  specifying it in the ``get()`` method

.. tip::

   The ``groupBy()`` method calls the MongoDB ``$group`` aggregation operator
   and ``$last`` accumulator operator. To learn more about these operators, see
   :manual:`$group (aggregation) </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`
   in the {+server-docs-name+}.
