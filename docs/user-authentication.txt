Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate users stored in MongoDB
by using Laravel's native authentication functionality. 

Laravel provides a native Auth module that includes authentication services,
such as guards that define how users are authenticated and providers that define
how users are retrieved. To learn more about these services, see `Authentication 
<https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/authentication>`__ in the
Laravel documentation.

Modify the User Model
---------------------

By default, Laravel generates the ``User`` Eloquent model in your ``App/Models``
directory. To enable authentication for users stored in MongoDB, your ``User`` model
must extend the ``MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User`` class. 

To extend this class, navigate to your ``app/Models/User.php`` file and replace the
``use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable`` use statement with the following
code:

.. code-block:: php

   use MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

Ensure that your ``User`` class extends ``Authenticatable``, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: php

   class User extends Authenticatable
   {
   ...
   }

After configuring your ``User`` model, create a corresponding controller. For instructions on
creating a controller, see the :ref:`laravel-auth-controller` section on this page.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code demonstrates a ``User.php`` file that extends the ``MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User``
class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/auth/AuthUser.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

.. _laravel-auth-controller:

Create the User Controller 
--------------------------

To store functions that manage authentication, create an authentication controller for
your ``User`` model. 

Run the following command from your project root to create a controller:

.. code-block:: php

   php artisan make:controller <filename>

Example
~~~~~~~

The following command creates a controller file called ``AuthController.php``:

.. code-block:: php

   php artisan make:controller AuthController

The ``AuthController.php`` file can store ``login()`` and ``logout()`` functions to
manage user authentication, as shown in the following code: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/auth/AuthController.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

Enable Password Reminders 
-------------------------

To add support for MongoDB-based password reminders, register the following service
provider in your application:

.. code-block:: php

   MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\PasswordResetServiceProvider::class

This service provider modifies the internal ``DatabaseReminderRepository``
to enable password reminders.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code updates the ``providers.php`` file in the ``bootstrap`` directory
of a Laravel application to register the ``PasswordResetServiceProvider`` provider:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   return [
     App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
     MongoDB\Laravel\MongoDBServiceProvider::class,
     MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\PasswordResetServiceProvider::class
   ];
