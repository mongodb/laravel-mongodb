Overview
--------

You can use the
`GridFS Adapter for Flysystem <https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/adapter/gridfs/>`__
to store large files in MongoDB.
GridFS lets you store files of unlimited size in the same database as your data.


Configuration
-------------

Before using the GridFS driver, install the Flysystem GridFS package through the
Composer package manager by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require league/flysystem-gridfs

Configure `Laravel File Storage <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/filesystem>`__
to use the ``gridfs`` driver in ``config/filesystems.php``:

.. code-block:: php

   'disks' => [
       'gridfs' => [
           'driver' => 'gridfs',
           'connection' => 'mongodb',
           // 'database' => null,
           // 'bucket' => 'fs',
           // 'prefix' => '',
           // 'read-only' => false,
           // 'throw' => false,
       ],
   ],

You can configure the disk the following settings in ``config/filesystems.php``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``driver``
     - **Required**. Specifies the filesystem driver to use. Must be ``gridfs`` for MongoDB.

   * - ``connection``
     - The database connection used to store jobs. It must be a ``mongodb`` connection. The driver uses the default connection if a connection is not specified.

   * - ``database``
     - Name of the MongoDB database for the GridFS bucket. The driver uses the database of the connection if a database is not specified.

   * - ``bucket``
     - Name or instance of the GridFS bucket. A database can contain multiple buckets identified by their name. Defaults to ``fs``.

   * - ``prefix``
     - Specifies a prefix for the name of the files that are stored in the bucket. Using a distinct bucket is recommended
       in order to store the files in a different collection.

   * - ``read-only``
     - If ``true``, writing to the GridFS bucket is disabled. Write operations will return ``false`` or throw exceptions
       depending on the configuration of ``throw``. Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``throw``
     - If ``true``, exceptions are thrown when an operation cannot be performed. If ``false``,
	   operations return ``true`` on success and ``false`` on error. Defaults to ``false``.

You can also use a factory or a service name to create an instance of ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket``.
In this case, the options ``connection`` and ``database`` are ignored:

.. code-block:: php

   use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
   use MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket;

   'disks' => [
       'gridfs' => [
           'driver' => 'gridfs',
           'bucket' => static function (Application $app): Bucket {
               return $app['db']->connection('mongodb')
                   ->getMongoDB()
                   ->selectGridFSBucket([
                       'bucketName' => 'avatars',
                       'chunkSizeBytes' => 261120,
                   ]);
           },
       ],
   ],

Usage
-----

A benefit of using Laravel Filesystem is that it provides a common interface
for all the supported file systems. You can use the ``gridfs`` disk in the same
way as the ``local`` disk.

.. code-block:: php

   $disk = Storage::disk('gridfs');

   // Write the file "hello.txt" into GridFS
   $disk->put('hello.txt', 'Hello World!');

   // Read the file
   echo $disk->get('hello.txt'); // Hello World!

`Laravel File Storage <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/filesystem>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

Versioning
----------

File names in GridFS are metadata in file documents, which are identified by
unique ObjectIDs. If multiple documents share the same file name, they are
considered "revisions" and further distinguished by creation timestamps.

The Laravel MongoDB integration uses the GridFS Flysystem adapter. It interacts
with file revisions in the following ways:

- Reading a file reads the last revision of this file name
- Writing a file creates a new revision for this file name
- Renaming a file renames all the revisions of this file name
- Deleting a file deletes all the revisions of this file name

The GridFS Adapter for Flysystem does not provide access to a specific revision
of a filename. You must use the
`GridFS API <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/gridfs/>`__
if you need to work with revisions, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: php

   // Create a bucket service from the MongoDB connection
   /** @var \MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket $bucket */
   $bucket = $app['db']->connection('mongodb')->getMongoDB()->selectGridFSBucket();

   // Download the last but one version of a file
   $bucket->openDownloadStreamByName('hello.txt', ['revision' => -2])
