You can delete a document in a collection by retrieving a single Eloquent model and calling
the ``delete()`` method, or by calling ``delete()`` directly on a query builder.

To delete a document, pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method, sort the matching documents,
and call the ``limit()`` method to retrieve only the first document. Then, delete this matching
document by calling the ``delete()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Deletes a document from the ``movies`` collection that matches a query filter

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``title`` field is ``'Quiz Show'``
- ``orderBy()``: sorts matched documents by their ascending ``_id`` values
- ``limit()``: retrieves only the first matching document
- ``delete()``: deletes the retrieved document
