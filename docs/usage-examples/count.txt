You can count the number of documents returned by a query by calling the ``where()`` and
``count()`` methods on an object collection or a query builder.

To return the number of documents that match a filter, pass the query filter to the ``where()``
method and call the ``count()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Counts the documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter
- Prints the matching document count

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``genres`` field includes ``"Biography"``.
- ``count()``: counts the number of matching documents. This method returns an integer value.
