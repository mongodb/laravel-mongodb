You can update multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``update()`` method
on a query builder.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method to retrieve documents that meet a
set of criteria. Then, update the matching documents by passing your intended
document changes to the ``update()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Updates documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter
- Prints the number of updated documents

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``imdb.rating`` nested field
  is greater than ``9``.
- ``update()``: updates the matching documents by adding an ``acclaimed`` field and setting
  its value to ``true``. This method returns the number of documents that were successfully
  updated.
