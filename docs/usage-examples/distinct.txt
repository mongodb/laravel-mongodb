You can retrieve distinct field values of documents in a collection by calling the ``distinct()``
method on an object collection or a query builder.

To retrieve distinct field values, pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method and a field name
to the ``select()`` method. Then, call ``distinct()`` to return the unique values of the selected
field in documents that match the query filter.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Retrieves distinct field values of documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter
- Prints the distinct values

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``directors`` field includes ``'Sofia Coppola'``.
- ``select()``: retrieves the matching documents' ``imdb.rating`` field values.
- ``distinct()``: accesses the unique values of the ``imdb.rating`` field among the matching
  documents. This method returns a list of values.
- ``get()``: retrieves the query results.
