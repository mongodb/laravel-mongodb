.. _laravel-find-one-usage:

===============
Find a Document
===============

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/operation-description.rst

   .. replacement:: operator-description

      You can retrieve a single document from a collection

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method and then call the ``first()`` method to
return one document in the collection that matches the filter. If multiple documents match
the query filter, ``first()`` returns the first matching document according to the documents'
:term:`natural order` in the database or according to the sort order that you can specify
by using the ``orderBy()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Retrieves a document from the ``movies`` collection that matches a query filter
- Prints the retrieved document

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``directors`` field includes ``"Rob Reiner"``.
- ``orderBy()``: sorts matched documents by their ascending ``_id`` values.
- ``first()``: retrieves only the first matching document.
