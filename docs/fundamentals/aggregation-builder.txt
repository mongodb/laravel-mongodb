Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform aggregations and construct
pipelines by using the {+odm-short+} aggregation builder. The aggregation
builder lets you use a typesafe syntax to construct a MongoDB
**aggregation pipeline**.

An aggregation pipeline is a data processing pipeline that sequentially
performs transformations and computations on input data, and outputs the
results as a new set of documents.

An aggregation pipeline is composed of **aggregation stages**, which are
operators that process input data and output data that the next stage uses as
its input.

The {+odm-short+} aggregation builder lets you build aggregation stages and
aggregation pipelines. The following sections show examples of how to use the
aggregation builder to create the stages of an aggregation pipeline:

- :ref:`laravel-add-aggregation-dependency`
- :ref:`laravel-build-aggregation`
- :ref:`laravel-create-custom-operator-factory`

.. tip::

   The aggregation builder feature is available only in {+odm-short+} versions
   4.3 and later. To learn more about running aggregations without using the
   aggregation builder, see :ref:`laravel-query-builder-aggregations` in the
   Query Builder guide.

.. _laravel-add-aggregation-dependency:

Add the Aggregation Builder Dependency
--------------------------------------

The aggregation builder is part of the {+agg-builder-package-name+} package.
You must add this package as a dependency to your project to use it. Run the
following command to add the aggregation builder dependency to your
application:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require {+agg-builder-package-name+}:{+agg-builder-version+}

When the installation completes, verify that the ``composer.json`` file
includes the following line in the ``require`` object:

.. code-block:: json

   "{+agg-builder-package-name+}": "{+agg-builder-version+}",

.. _laravel-build-aggregation:

Create an Aggregation Pipeline
------------------------------

To start an aggregation pipeline, call the ``Model::aggregate()`` method.
Then, chain the aggregation stage methods in the sequence you want them to
run.

The aggregation builder includes the following namespaces that you can import
to build aggregation stages:

- ``MongoDB\Builder\Accumulator``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Expression``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Query``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Type``

.. tip::

   To learn more about builder classes, see the `mongodb/mongodb-php-builder <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-builder/>`__
   GitHub repository.

This section features the following examples, which show how to use common
aggregation stages and combine stages to build an aggregation pipeline:

- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-match-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-group-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-sort-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-project-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-pipeline-example`

To learn more about MongoDB aggregation operators, see
:manual:`Aggregation Stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in
the {+server-docs-name+}.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples run aggregation pipelines on a collection represented
by the ``User`` model. You can add the sample data by running the following
``insert()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation builder sample data
      :end-before: end aggregation builder sample data

.. _laravel-aggregation-match-stage-example:

Match Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``match()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
a query filter. If you omit this stage, the ``aggregate()`` method outputs
all the documents in the model's collection for the following stage.

This aggregation stage is often placed first to retrieve the data by using
available indexes and reduce the amount of data the subsequent stages process.

.. tip::

   If you omit the ``match()`` method, the aggregation pipeline matches all
   documents in the collection that correspond to the model before other
   aggregation stages.

This example constructs a query filter for a **match** aggregation stage by
using the ``MongoDB\Builder\Query`` builder. The match stage includes the the
following criteria:

- Returns results that match either of the query filters by using the
  ``Query::or()`` function
- Matches documents that contain an ``occupation`` field with a value of
  ``"designer"`` by using the ``Query::query()`` and ``Query::eq()`` functions
- Matches documents that contain a ``name`` field with a value of
  ``"Eliud Nkosana"`` by using the ``Query::query()`` and ``Query::eq()``
  functions

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the documents
returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation match stage
      :end-before: end aggregation match stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "541728000000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "449884800000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "834019200000"
            }
          }
        }
      ]

.. tip::

   The ``Query::or()`` function corresponds to the ``$or`` MongoDB query operator.
   To learn more about this operator, see :manual:`$or </reference/operator/query/or/>`
   in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-aggregation-group-stage-example:

Group Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``group()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to modify the
structure of the data by performing calculations and grouping it by common
field values.

This aggregation stage is often placed immediately after a match stage to
reduce the data subsequent stages process.

This example uses the ``MongoDB\Builder\Expression`` builder to define the group keys in a
**group** aggregation stage. The group stage specifies the following grouping
behavior:

- Sets the value of the group key, represented by the ``_id`` field, to the
  field value defined by the ``Expression`` builder
- References the document values in the ``occupation`` field by calling the
  ``Expression::fieldPath()`` function

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the documents
returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation group stage
      :end-before: end aggregation group stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "_id": "engineer" },
        { "_id": "designer" }
      ]

.. tip::

   This example stage performs a similar task as the ``distinct()`` query
   builder method. To learn more about the ``distinct()`` method, see the
   :ref:`laravel-distinct-usage` usage example.

.. _laravel-aggregation-sort-stage-example:

Sort Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``sort()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
the documents' output order.

You can add this aggregation stage anywhere in the pipeline. It is often
placed after the group stage since it can depend on the grouped data. We
recommend placing the sort stage as late as possible in the pipeline to limit
the data it processes.

To specify an ascending sort, set the field value to the ``Sort::Asc`` enum.

To specify a descending sort, set the field value to the ``Sort::Desc`` enum.

This example shows a ``sort()`` aggregation pipeline stage that sorts the
documents by the ``name`` field to ``Sort::Desc``, corresponding to reverse
alphabetical order. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see
the documents returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation sort stage
      :end-before: end aggregation sort stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "541728000000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Francois Soma",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "886377600000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "834019200000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "449884800000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Bran Steafan",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "894326400000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Alda Gröndal",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "1009843200000"
            }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _laravel-aggregation-project-stage-example:

Project Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``project()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
which fields from the documents to display by this stage.

To specify fields to include, pass the name of a field and a truthy value,
such as ``1`` or ``true``. All other fields are omitted from the output.

Alternatively, to specify fields to exclude, pass each field name and
a falsy value, such as ``0`` or ``false``. All other fields are included in
the output.

.. tip::

   When you specify fields to include, the ``_id`` field is included by default.
   To exclude the ``_id`` field, explicitly exclude it in the projection stage.

This example shows how to use the ``project()`` method aggregation stage to
include only the ``name`` field and exclude all other fields from the output.
Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation project stage
      :end-before: end aggregation project stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "name": "Alda Gröndal" },
        { "name": "Francois Soma" },
        { "name": "Janet Doe" },
        { "name": "Eliud Nkosana" },
        { "name": "Bran Steafan" },
        { "name": "Ellis Lee" }
      ]


.. _laravel-aggregation-pipeline-example:

Aggregation Pipeline Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This aggregation pipeline example chains multiple stages. Each stage runs
on the output retrieved from each preceding stage. In this example, the
stages perform the following operations sequentially:

- Match all documents in the collection since the ``match()`` stage
  is omitted.
- Add the ``birth_year`` field to the documents and set the value to the year
  extracted from the ``birthday`` field.
- Group the documents by the value of the ``occupation`` field and compute
  the average value of ``birth_year`` for each group by using the
  ``Accumulator::avg()`` function. Assign to result of the computation to
  the ``birth_year_avg`` field.
- Sort the documents by the group key field in ascending order.
- Create the ``profession`` field from the value of the group key field,
  include the ``birth_year_avg`` field, and omit the ``_id`` field.

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin pipeline example
      :end-before: end pipeline example

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "birth_year_avg": 1991.5,
          "profession": "designer"
        },
        {
          "birth_year_avg": 1995.5,
          "profession": "engineer"
        }
      ]


.. _laravel-create-custom-operator-factory:

Create a Custom Operator Factory
--------------------------------

When using the aggregation builder to create an aggregation pipeline, you
can define operations or stages in a **custom operator factory**. A custom
operator factory is a function that returns expressions or stages of an
aggregation pipeline. You can create these functions to improve code
readability and reuse.

This example shows how to create and use a custom operator factory that
returns expressions that extract the year from a specified date field.

The following function accepts the name of a field that contains a date
and returns an expression that extracts the year from the date:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start custom operator factory function
   :end-before: end custom operator factory function

The example aggregation pipeline includes the following stages:

- ``addFields()``, which calls the custom operator factory function to extract
  the year from the ``birthday`` field and assign it to the ``birth_year`` field
- ``project()``, which includes only the ``name`` and ``birth_year`` fields in
  its output

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin custom operator factory usage
      :end-before: end custom operator factory usage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "name": "Alda Gröndal",
          "birth_year": 2002
        },
        {
          "name": "Francois Soma",
          "birth_year": 1998
        },
        {
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "birth_year": 1987
        },
        {
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "birth_year": 1984
        },
        {
          "name": "Bran Steafan",
          "birth_year": 1998
        },
        {
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "birth_year": 1996
        }
      ]
