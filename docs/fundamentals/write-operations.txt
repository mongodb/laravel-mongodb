Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+odm-short+} to perform
**write operations** on your MongoDB collections. Write operations include
inserting, updating, and deleting data based on specified criteria.

This guide shows you how to perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-insert-documents`
- :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-modify-documents`
- :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-delete-documents`

.. _laravel-fundamentals-write-sample-model:

Sample Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The write operations in this guide reference the following Eloquent model class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/Concert.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :caption: Concert.php

.. tip::

   The ``$fillable`` attribute lets you use Laravel mass assignment for insert
   operations. To learn more about mass assignment, see :ref:`laravel-model-mass-assignment`
   in the Eloquent Model Class documentation.

   The ``$casts`` attribute instructs Laravel to convert attributes to common
   data types. To learn more, see `Attribute Casting <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting>`__
   in the Laravel documentation.

.. _laravel-fundamentals-insert-documents:

Insert Documents
----------------

In this section, you can learn how to insert documents into MongoDB collections
from your Laravel application by using the {+odm-long+}.

When you insert the documents, ensure the data does not violate any
unique indexes on the collection. When inserting the first document of a
collection or creating a new collection, MongoDB automatically creates a
unique index on the ``_id`` field.

For more information on creating indexes on MongoDB collections by using the
Laravel schema builder, see the :ref:`laravel-eloquent-indexes` section
of the Schema Builder documentation.

To learn more about Eloquent models in {+odm-short+}, see the :ref:`laravel-eloquent-models`
section.

Insert a Document Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These examples show how to use the ``save()`` Eloquent method to insert an
instance of a ``Concert`` model as a MongoDB document.

When the ``save()`` method succeeds, you can access the model instance on
which you called the method.

If the operation fails, the model instance is assigned ``null``.

This example code performs the following actions:

- Creates a new instance of the ``Concert`` model
- Assigns string values to the ``performer`` and ``venue`` fields
- Assigns an array of strings to the ``genre`` field
- Assigns a number to the ``ticketsSold`` field
- Assigns a date to the ``performanceDate`` field by using the ``Carbon``
  package
- Inserts the document by calling the ``save()`` method

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model insert one
   :end-before: end model insert one
   :caption: Insert a document by calling the save() method on an instance.

You can retrieve the inserted document's ``_id`` value by accessing the model's
``id`` member, as shown in the following code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin inserted id
   :end-before: end inserted id

If you enable mass assignment by defining either the ``$fillable`` or
``$guarded`` attributes, you can use the Eloquent model ``create()`` method
to perform the insert in a single call, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model insert one mass assign
   :end-before: end model insert one mass assign

To learn more about the Carbon PHP API extension, see the
:github:`Carbon <briannesbitt/Carbon>` GitHub repository.

Insert Multiple Documents Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use the ``insert()`` Eloquent method to insert
multiple instances of a ``Concert`` model as MongoDB documents. This bulk
insert method reduces the number of calls your application needs to make
to save the documents.

When the ``insert()`` method succeeds, it returns the value ``1``.

If it fails, it throws an exception.

The example code saves multiple models in a single call by passing them as
an array to the ``insert()`` method:

.. note::

   This example wraps the dates in the `MongoDB\\BSON\\UTCDateTime <{+phplib-api+}/class.mongodb-bson-utcdatetime.php>`__
   class to convert it to a type MongoDB can serialize because Laravel
   skips attribute casting on bulk insert operations.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model insert many
   :end-before: end model insert many

.. _laravel-fundamentals-modify-documents:

Modify Documents
----------------

In this section, you can learn how to modify documents in your MongoDB
collection from your Laravel application. Use update operations to modify
existing documents or to insert a document if none match the search
criteria.

You can persist changes on an instance of an Eloquent model or use
Eloquent's fluent syntax to chain an update operation on methods that
return a Laravel collection object.

This section provides examples of the following update operations:

- :ref:`Update a document <laravel-modify-documents-update-one>`
- :ref:`Update multiple documents <laravel-modify-documents-update-multiple>`
- :ref:`Update or insert in a single operation <laravel-modify-documents-upsert>`
- :ref:`Update arrays in a document <laravel-modify-documents-arrays>`

.. _laravel-modify-documents-update-one:

Update a Document Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update a document in the following ways:

- Modify an instance of the model and save the changes by calling the ``save()``
  method.
- Chain methods to retrieve an instance of a model and perform updates on it
  by calling the ``update()`` method.

The following example shows how to update a document by modifying an instance
of the model and calling its ``save()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model update one save
   :end-before: end model update one save
   :caption: Update a document by calling the save() method on an instance.

When the ``save()`` method succeeds, the model instance on which you called the
method contains the updated values.

If the operation fails, {+odm-short+} assigns the model instance a ``null`` value.

The following example shows how to update a document by chaining methods to
retrieve and update the first matching document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model update one fluent
   :end-before: end model update one fluent
   :caption: Update the matching document by chaining the update() method.

.. include:: /includes/fact-orderby-id.rst

When the ``update()`` method succeeds, the operation returns the number of
documents updated.

If the retrieve part of the call does not match any documents, {+odm-short+}
returns the following error:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: Call to a member function update() on null

.. _laravel-modify-documents-update-multiple:

Update Multiple Documents Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an update on one or more documents, chain the ``update()``
method to the results of a method that retrieves the documents as a
Laravel collection object, such as ``where()``.

The following example shows how to chain calls to retrieve matching documents
and update them:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model update multiple
   :end-before: end model update multiple

When the ``update()`` method succeeds, the operation returns the number of
documents updated.

If the retrieve part of the call does not match any documents in the
collection, {+odm-short+} returns the following error:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: Call to a member function update() on null

.. _laravel-modify-documents-upsert:

Update or Insert in a Single Operation
--------------------------------------

An **upsert** operation lets you perform an update or insert in a single
operation. This operation streamlines the task of updating a document or
inserting one if it does not exist.

To specify an upsert in an ``update()`` method, set the ``upsert`` option to
``true`` as shown in the following code example:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :copyable: false

   YourModel::where(/* match criteria */)
      ->update(
          [/* update data */],
          ['upsert' => true]);

When the ``update()`` method is chained to a query, it performs one of the
following actions:

- If the query matches documents, the ``update()`` method modifies the matching
  documents.
- If the query matches zero documents, the ``update()`` method inserts a
  document that contains the update data and the equality match criteria data.

Upsert Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to pass the ``upsert`` option to the  ``update()``
method to perform an update or insert in a single operation. Click the
:guilabel:`VIEW OUTPUT` button to see the example document inserted when no
matching documents exist:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin model upsert
      :end-before: end model upsert

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id": "660c...",
        "performer": "Jon Batiste",
        "venue": "Radio City Music Hall",
        "genres": [
          "R&B",
          "soul"
        ],
        "ticketsSold": 4000,
        "updated_at": ...
      }

.. _laravel-modify-documents-arrays:

Update Arrays in a Document
---------------------------

In this section, you can see examples of the following operations that
update array values in a MongoDB document:

- :ref:`Add values to an array <laravel-modify-documents-add-array-values>`
- :ref:`Remove values from an array <laravel-modify-documents-remove-array-values>`
- :ref:`Update the value of an array element <laravel-modify-documents-update-array-values>`

These examples modify the sample document created by the following insert
operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin array example document
   :end-before: end array example document

.. _laravel-modify-documents-add-array-values:

Add Values to an Array Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows how to use the ``push()`` method to add values to an array
in a MongoDB document. You can pass one or more values to add and set the
optional parameter ``unique`` to ``true`` to skip adding any duplicate values
in the array. The following code example shows the structure of a ``push()``
method call:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   YourModel::where(<match criteria>)
      ->push(
          <field name>,
          [<values>], // array or single value to add
          unique: true); // whether to skip existing values

The following example shows how to add the value ``"baroque"`` to
the ``genres`` array field of a matching document. Click the
:guilabel:`VIEW OUTPUT` button to see the updated document:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin model array push
      :end-before: end model array push

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id": "660eb...",
        "performer": "Mitsuko Uchida",
        "genres": [
            "classical",
            "dance-pop",

        ],
        "updated_at": ...,
        "created_at": ...
      }


.. _laravel-modify-documents-remove-array-values:

Remove Values From an Array Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows how to use the ``pull()`` method to remove values from
an array in a MongoDB document. You can pass one or more values to remove
from the array. The following code example shows the structure of a
``pull()`` method call:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   YourModel::where(<match criteria>)
      ->pull(
          <field name>,
          [<values>]); // array or single value to remove

The following example shows how to remove array values ``"classical"`` and
``"dance-pop"`` from the ``genres`` array field. Click the
:guilabel:`VIEW OUTPUT` button to see the updated document:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin model array pull
      :end-before: end model array pull

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id": "660e...",
        "performer": "Mitsuko Uchida",
        "genres": [],
        "updated_at": ...,
        "created_at": ...
      }


.. _laravel-modify-documents-update-array-values:

Update the Value of an Array Element Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows how to use the ``$`` positional operator to update specific
array elements in a MongoDB document. The ``$`` operator represents the first
array element that matches the query. The following code example shows the
structure of a positional operator update call on a single matching document:


.. note::

   Currently, {+odm-short+} offers this operation only on the ``DB`` facade
   and not on the Eloquent ORM.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   DB::connection('mongodb')
      ->getCollection(<collection name>)
      ->updateOne(
          <match criteria>,
          ['$set' => ['<array field>.$' => <replacement value>]]);


The following example shows how to replace the array value ``"dance-pop"``
with ``"contemporary"`` in the ``genres`` array field. Click the
:guilabel:`VIEW OUTPUT` button to see the updated document:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin model array positional
      :end-before: end model array positional

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id": "660e...",
        "performer": "Mitsuko Uchida",
        "genres": [
          "classical",
          "contemporary"
        ],
        "updated_at": ...,
        "created_at": ...
      }

To learn more about array update operators, see :manual:`Array Update Operators </reference/operator/update-array/>`
in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-fundamentals-delete-documents:

Delete Documents
----------------

In this section, you can learn how to delete documents from a MongoDB collection
by using {+odm-short+}. Use delete operations to remove data from your MongoDB
database.

This section provides examples of the following delete operations:

- :ref:`Delete one document <laravel-fundamentals-delete-one>`
- :ref:`Delete multiple documents <laravel-fundamentals-delete-many>`

To learn about the Laravel features available in {+odm-short+} that modify
delete behavior, see the following sections:

- :ref:`Soft delete <laravel-model-soft-delete>`, which lets you mark
  documents as deleted instead of removing them from the database
- :ref:`Pruning <laravel-model-pruning>`, which lets you define conditions
  that qualify a document for automatic deletion

.. _laravel-fundamentals-delete-one:

Delete a Document Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete one document in the following ways:

- Call the ``$model->delete()`` method on an instance of the model.
- Call the ``Model::destroy($id)`` method on the model, passing it the id of
  the document to be deleted.
- Chain methods to retrieve and delete an instance of a model by calling the
  ``delete()`` method.

The following example shows how to delete a document by calling ``$model->delete()``
on an instance of the model:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin delete one model
   :end-before: end delete one model
   :caption: Delete the document by calling the delete() method on an instance.

When the ``delete()`` method succeeds, the operation returns the number of
documents deleted.

If the retrieve part of the call does not match any documents in the collection,
the operation returns ``0``.

The following example shows how to delete a document by passing the value of
its id to the ``Model::destroy($id)`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model delete by id
   :end-before: end model delete by id
   :caption: Delete the document by its id value.

When the ``destroy()`` method succeeds, it returns the number of documents
deleted.

If the id value does not match any documents, the ``destroy()`` method
returns returns ``0``.

The following example shows how to chain calls to retrieve the first
matching document and delete it:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model delete one fluent
   :end-before: end model delete one fluent
   :caption: Delete the matching document by chaining the delete() method.

.. include:: /includes/fact-orderby-id.rst

When the ``delete()`` method succeeds, it returns the number of documents
deleted.

If the ``where()`` method does not match any documents, the ``delete()`` method
returns returns ``0``.

.. _laravel-fundamentals-delete-many:

Delete Multiple Documents Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete multiple documents in the following ways:


- Call the ``Model::destroy($ids)`` method, passing a list of the ids of the
  documents or model instances to be deleted.
- Chain methods to retrieve a Laravel collection object that references
  multiple objects and delete them by calling the ``delete()`` method.

The following example shows how to delete a document by passing an array of
id values, represented by ``$ids``, to the ``destroy()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model delete multiple by id
   :end-before: end model delete multiple by id
   :caption: Delete documents by their ids.

.. tip::

   The ``destroy()`` method performance suffers when passed large lists. For
   better performance, use ``Model::whereIn('id', $ids)->delete()`` instead.

When the ``destroy()`` method succeeds, it returns the number of documents
deleted.

If the id values do not match any documents, the ``destroy()`` method
returns returns ``0``.

The following example shows how to chain calls to retrieve matching documents
and delete them:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/write-operations/WriteOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin model delete multiple fluent
   :end-before: end model delete multiple fluent
   :caption: Chain calls to retrieve matching documents and delete them.

When the ``delete()`` method succeeds, it returns the number of documents
deleted.

If the ``where()`` method does not match any documents, the ``delete()`` method
returns ``0``.
