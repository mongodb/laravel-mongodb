Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+odm-long+} to access
and manage MongoDB databases and collections.

MongoDB organizes data in a hierarchical structure. A MongoDB
deployment contains one or more **databases**, and each database
contains one or more **collections**. In each collection, MongoDB stores
data as **documents** that contain field-and-value pairs. In
the {+odm-short+}, you can access documents through Eloquent models.

To learn more about the document data format,
see :manual:`Documents </core/document/>` in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-access-db:

Specify the Database in a Connection Configuration
--------------------------------------------------

You can specify a database name that a connection uses in your
application's ``config/database.php`` file. The ``connections`` property
in this file stores all your database connection information, such as
your connection string, database name, and optionally, authentication
details. After you specify a database connection, you can perform
database-level operations and access collections that the database
contains.

If you set the database name in the ``database`` property to the name of a
nonexistent database, Laravel still makes a valid connection. When you
insert any data into a collection in the database, the server creates it
automatically.

The following example shows how to set a default database connection and
create a database connection to the ``animals`` database in the
``config/database.php`` file by setting the ``dsn`` and ``database`` properties:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

   'default' => 'mongodb',

   'connections' => [

       'mongodb' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'dsn' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017/',
           'database' => 'animals',
       ], ...
   ]

When you set a default database connection, the {+odm-short+} uses that
connection for operations, but you can specify multiple database connections
in your ``config/database.php`` file.

The following example shows how to specify multiple database connections
(``mongodb`` and ``mongodb_alt``) to access the ``animals`` and
``plants`` databases:

.. code-block:: php

   'connections' => [

       'mongodb' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'dsn' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017/',
           'database' => 'animals',
       ],

       'mongodb_alt' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'dsn' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017/',
           'database' => 'plants',
       ]

   ], ...

.. note::

   The MongoDB PHP driver reuses the same connection when
   you create two clients with the same connection string. There is no
   overhead in using two connections for two distinct databases, so it is
   unnecessary to optimize your connections.

If your application contains multiple database connections and you want
to store your model in a database other than the default, override the
``$connection`` property in your ``Model`` class.

The following example shows how to override the ``$connection`` property
on the ``Flower`` model class to use the ``mongodb_alt`` connection.
This directs the {+odm-short+} to store the model in the ``flowers``
collection of the ``plants`` database, instead of in the default database:

.. code-block:: php

   class Flower extends Model
   {
       protected $connection = 'mongodb_alt';
   }

.. _laravel-access-coll:

Access a Collection
-------------------

When you create model class that extends
``MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model``, the {+odm-short+} stores the model data
in a collection with a name formatted as the snake case plural form of your
model class name.

For example, if you create a model class called ``Flower``,
Laravel applies the model to the ``flowers`` collection in the database.

.. tip::

   To learn how to specify a different collection name in your model class, see the
   :ref:`laravel-model-customize-collection-name` section of the Eloquent
   Model Class guide.

We generally recommend that you use the Eloquent ORM to access a collection
for code readability and maintainability. The following
example specifies a find operation by using the ``Flower`` class, so
Laravel retrieves results from the ``flowers`` collection:

.. code-block:: php

   Flower::where('name', 'Water Lily')->get()

.. note::

   Starting in {+odm-short+} v4.8, the ``DB::collection()`` method
   is deprecated. As shown in the following example, you can use the ``DB::table()``
   method to access a MongoDB collection.

If you are unable to accomplish your operation by using an Eloquent
model, you can access the query builder by calling the ``table()``
method on the ``DB`` facade. The following example shows the same query
as in the preceding example, but the query is constructed by using the
``DB::table()`` method:

.. code-block:: php

   DB::connection('mongodb')
       ->table('flowers')
       ->where('name', 'Water Lily')
       ->get()

List Collections
----------------

You can take either of the following actions to see information
about the collections in a database:

- :ref:`laravel-list-coll-command`
- :ref:`laravel-list-coll-methods`

.. _laravel-list-coll-command:

Run a Shell Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can list the collections in a database by running the following
command in your shell from your project's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan db:show

This command outputs information about the configured database and lists its
collections under the ``Table`` header. For more information about the ``db:show``
command, see `Laravel: New DB Commands <https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-new-db-commands-and-more>`__
on the official Laravel blog.

.. _laravel-list-coll-methods:

Call Database or Schema Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can list the collections in a database by calling the following
methods in your application:

- ``DB::listCollections()``: lists information about each collection by
  using the query builder
- ``Schema::getTablesListing()``: lists the name of each collection by
  using the schema builder
- ``Schema::getTables()``: lists the name and size of each collection by
  using the schema builder

.. note::

   MongoDB is a schemaless database, so the preceding schema builder methods
   query the database data rather than the schema.

Example
```````

The following example accesses a database connection, then calls the
``listCollections()`` query builder method to retrieve information about
the collections in the database:

.. code-block:: php

   $collections = DB::connection('mongodb')->getMongoDB()->listCollections();

List Collection Fields
----------------------

You can take either of the following actions to see information
about each field in a collection:

- :ref:`laravel-list-fields-command`
- :ref:`laravel-list-fields-methods`

.. _laravel-list-fields-command:

Run a Shell Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can see a list of fields in a collection by running the following
command in your shell from your project's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan db:table <collection name>

This command outputs each collection field and its corresponding data type
under the ``Column`` header. For more information about the ``db:table``
command, see `Laravel: New DB Commands <https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-new-db-commands-and-more>`__
on the official Laravel blog.

.. _laravel-list-fields-methods:

Call Schema Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can list the fields in a collection by calling the ``Schema::getColumns()``
schema builder method in your application.

You can also use the following methods to return more information about the
collection fields:

- ``Schema::hasColumn(string $<collection>, string $<field name>)``:
  checks if the specified field exists in at least one document
- ``Schema::hasColumns(string $<collection>, string[] $<field names>)``:
  checks if each specified field exists in at least one document

MongoDB is a schemaless database, so the preceding methods query the collection
data rather than the database schema. If the specified collection doesn't exist
or is empty, these methods return a value of ``false``.

.. note:: id Alias

   Starting in {+odm-long+} v5.1, the ``getColumns()`` method represents
   the ``_id`` field name in a MongoDB collection as the alias ``id`` in
   the returned list of field names. You can pass either ``_id`` or
   ``id`` to the ``hasColumn()`` and ``hasColumns()`` methods.

Example
```````

The following example passes a collection name to the ``Schema::getColumns()``
method to retrieve each field in the ``flowers`` collection:

.. code-block:: php

   $fields = Schema::getColumns('flowers');

Create and Drop Collections
---------------------------

To learn how to create and drop collections, see the
:ref:`laravel-eloquent-migrations` section in the Schema Builder guide.
