Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the TLS protocol to secure 
your connection to a MongoDB deployment. To configure your connection to
use TLS, enable the TLS option and optionally provide your certificates for
validation in your application's ``config/database.php`` file.

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about TLS, see the Wikipedia entry on
   :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <w/index.php?title=Transport_Layer_Security&oldid=1184063676>`.

Enable TLS
----------

In your application's ``config/database.php`` file, you can enable TLS
on a connection to your MongoDB deployment in one of the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string
- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in the ``options`` property of
  your ``mongodb`` connection entry

Select from the following :guilabel:`Connection String` and
:guilabel:`Connection Options` tabs to see a corresponding code sample:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection string tls true

      .. code-block:: php
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         'connections' => [
      
             'mongodb' => [
                 'driver' => 'mongodb',
                 'dsn' => 'mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?tls=true',
                 'database' => 'myDB',
             ]
         ]

   .. tab:: Connection Options
      :tabid: options tls true
      
      .. code-block:: php
         :emphasize-lines: 8

         'connections' => [
      
             'mongodb' => [
                 'driver' => 'mongodb',
                 'dsn' => '<connection string>',
                 'database' => 'myDB',
                 'options'  => [
                     'tls' => true,
                 ],
             ]
         ]

      To view a full list of connection options, see
      :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-connection-options`.

.. note::
   
   If your connection string uses a DNS SRV record by including
   the ``mongodb+srv`` prefix, TLS is enabled on your connection by
   default.

Configure Certificates
----------------------

To successfully initiate a TLS request, your application might need to present 
cryptographic certificates to prove its identity. Your application's
certificates must be stored as PEM files to enable TLS when connecting.

.. important::

   For production use, we recommend that your MongoDB deployment use valid
   certificates generated and signed by the same certificate authority.
   For testing, your deployment can use self-signed certificates.

The following list describes the components that your client can
present to establish a TLS-enabled connection:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - TLS Component
     - Description

   * - Certificate Authority (CA)
     - One or more certificate authorities to
       trust when making a TLS connection. You can pass this file's path
       to the ``tlsCAFile`` option.

   * - Client Certificate
     - A digital certificate that allows the server to verify the identity
       of your application to establish an encrypted network connection.
       You can pass this file's path to the ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` option.

   * - Certificate Key
     - The client certificate private key file. This key is often
       included within the certificate file itself. If you must
       provide this item, the certificate and key should be concatenated
       in one file that you can pass to the ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``
       option.

   * - Passphrase
     - The password to decrypt the private client key if it is
       encrypted. You can pass this file's path to the
       ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`` option.

Reference Certificates
----------------------

If required, you must reference your certificates when configuring your ``mongodb``
connection so that the server can validate them before the client connects.

We recommend that you reference your certificates and set other TLS
options in the ``options`` property of your connection configuration
instead of in the connection string. This improves code readability in
your application.

Set the following options in the ``options`` property to reference your
certificates:

- ``tlsCAFile``
- ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``
- ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword``
   
.. note::

   For **testing purposes**, you can set the following options to
   ``true`` to disable validation:

   - ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``
   - ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``
   
   Or, you can set the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``true`` to implicitly set
   both of the preceding options.
   
   Specifying these options in a production environment might make
   your application insecure. To learn more, see the :manual:`Connection
   Options </reference/connection-string/#connection-options>`
   reference in the Server manual.

The following example configures a connection with TLS enabled:

.. code-block:: php

   'connections' => [
   
       'mongodb' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'dsn' => '<connection string>',
           'database' => 'myDB',
           'options'  => [
               'tls' => true,
               'tlsCAFile' => '<path to CA certificate>',
               'tlsCertificateKeyFile' => '<path to private client certificate>',
               'tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword' => '<path to client key passphrase>',
           ]
       ]
   ]
