Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to connect your Laravel application to a
MongoDB instance or replica set deployment by using {+odm-short+}.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Connection URI <laravel-connection-uri>`, which explains connection
  URIs and their constituent parts
- :ref:`laravel-database-config`, which explains how to set up your MongoDB
  database connection for your Laravel app.
- :ref:`Connection Example <laravel-atlas-connection-example>`, which  provides
  examples that show how to connect to MongoDB by using an Atlas connection
  string.
- :ref:`laravel-other-ways-to-connect` describes ways to connect to MongoDB
  deployments that are not hosted on Atlas.

.. _laravel-connection-uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A **connection URI**, also known as a connection string, specifies how
{+odm-short+} connects to MongoDB and how to behave while connected.

Parts of a Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following figure explains each part of a sample connection URI:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/connection_uri_parts.png
   :alt: Parts of a connection URI

In this connection URI, ``mongodb+srv`` is the protocol, which uses the
:manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`
for greater flexibility in your deployment and the ability to change the
servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients.

If the machine that hosts your MongoDB deployment does not support this
feature, use protocol for the
:manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-standard-connection-string-format>`
instead.

If you use a password-based authentication, the part of the connection
string after the protocol contains your username and password. Replace the
placeholder for ``user`` with your username and ``pass`` with your password.
If you use an authentication mechanism that does not require a username
and password, omit this part of the connection URI.

The part of the connection string after the credentials specifies your MongoDB
instance's hostname or IP address and port. The preceding example uses
``sample.host`` as the hostname and ``27017`` as the port. Replace these values
to point to your MongoDB instance.

The last part of the connection string specifies connection and authentication
options. In the example, we set the following connection options and values:

- ``maxPoolSize=20``
- ``w=majority``

.. _laravel-database-config:

Laravel Database Connection Configuration
------------------------------------------

{+odm-short+} lets you configure your MongoDB database connection in the
``config/database.php`` Laravel application file. You can specify the following
connection details in this file:

- ``default``, which specifies the default database connection to use when
  unspecified
- ``connections``, which contains database connection information to access
  various databases from your application

You can use the following code in the configuration file to set the default
connection to a corresponding ``"mongodb"`` entry in the ``connections`` array:

.. code-block:: php

   'default' => 'mongodb',

For a MongoDB database connection, you can specify the following details:

- ``driver``, which specifies the database driver to use for the connection
- ``dsn``, the data source name (DSN) that specifies the MongoDB connection URI
- ``host``, which you can use instead of the ``dsn`` setting to specify the
  network address of one or more MongoDB nodes
- ``database``, which specifies the name of the MongoDB database to read and
  write to
- ``username`` and ``password``, which you can optionally include to specify
  your database user's credentials to authenticate with MongoDB
- ``options`` and ``driverOptions``, which specify connection options to
  pass to the MongoDB driver

The following example shows how you can specify your MongoDB connection details
in a ``connections`` array entry:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: Example config/database.php MongoDB connection configuration

   'connections' => [
       'mongodb' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'dsn' => 'mongodb+srv//myUser:myPass123@sample.host:27017/',
           'database' => 'sample_mflix',
           'options' => [
               'maxPoolSize' => 20,
               'w' => 'majority',
           ],
           'driverOptions' => [
               'serverApi' => 1,
           ],
       ],
       // ...
   ],

The following sections provide common ways of specifying MongoDB connections.

.. _laravel-atlas-connection-example:

Connection Example
------------------

This section shows how to configure your Laravel application's DSN by using a
MongoDB Atlas connection string.

To add your MongoDB DSN to your Laravel application, make the following changes:

- Add the DSN as an environment variable in your project's ``.env`` environment
  configuration file. Set the variable value to your Atlas connection string.
- Add a connection entry for your MongoDB connection in the ``connections``
  array of your ``config/database.php`` configuration file. Set the ``dsn``
  value of the connection entry to reference the environment variable that
  contains your DSN.

The following examples show how to specify ``"mongodb+srv://myUser:myPass123@mongodb0.example.com/"``
as the connection string in the relevant configuration files:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: Sample .env environment configuration

   DB_URI=""mongodb+srv://myUser:myPass123@mongodb0.example.com/";

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: Sample config/database.php connection entry
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   'connections' => [
       'mongodb' => [
           'dsn' => env('DB_URI'), // uses the value of the DB_URI environment variable
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'database' => 'sample_mflix',
           // ...
       ],
     // ...
   ]

.. tip::

   To retrieve your Atlas connection string, follow the
   :ref:`Create a Connection String <laravel-quick-start-connection-string>`
   step of the Quick Start tutorial.

.. _laravel-other-ways-to-connect:

Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB
--------------------------------

The following sections show you how to connect to a single MongoDB server
instance or a replica set not hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

.. _laravel-connect-localhost:

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows an example connection string you can use when running a
Laravel application and MongoDB server from the same machine, such as your
local development environment.

To connect your application to a MongoDB instance hosted on the same machine,
you must complete the following tasks:

- Download, install, and run MongoDB server.
- Obtain the IP address and port on which your MongoDB server is running. If
  you use the default settings of a local installation of MongoDB server,
  the IP address is ``127.0.0.1``, and the port is ``27017``.
- Set up your ``config/database.php`` connection to reference the environment
  variable ``DB_URI`` for the value of the ``dsn``, as shown in the
  :ref:`laravel-atlas-connection-example` section.

The following example shows a sample connection string that you can add to the
``.env`` file if your application connects to a MongoDB server running on the
default IP address and port:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: Sample .env environment configuration to connect to a local MongoDB server.

   DB_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/";

To learn how to download  and install MongoDB server, see
:manual:`Install MongoDB Community Edition </installation/#mongodb-installation-tutorials>`
in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-connect-replica-set:

Connect to a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances, or nodes,
where the nodes store the same data set. This configuration of instances
provides data redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify each node's hostname and port
number, separated by commas, and the replica set name as the value of the
``replicaSet`` parameter in the connection string.

This example, which shows the connection string you can add to your
Laravel application's ``.env`` file to connect to a replica set, uses the
following sample values:

- ``host1``, ``host2``, and ``host3`` as the hostnames of the MongoDB nodes
- ``27017`` as the port on which MongoDB runs on those hosts
- ``myRS`` as the configured name of the replica set
- ``myUser`` and ``myPass123`` as the credentials of a database user

.. code-block:: bash

   DB_URI="mongodb://myUser:myPass123@host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRS"

When connecting to a replica set, the library that {+odm-short+} uses to manage
connections with MongoDB performs the following actions unless otherwise
specified:

- Discovers all replica set members when given the address of any one member.
- Sends operations to the appropriate member, such as instructions
  to write against the **primary** node. To learn more about the replica
  set primary, see :manual:`Replica Set Primary </core/replica-set-primary/>`
  in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. tip::

   You are required to specify only one host to connect to a replica set.
   However, to ensure connectivity when the selected host is unavailable,
   provide the full list of hosts.

To learn more about setting up a MongoDB replica set, see
:manual:`Deploy a Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set/>` in the
{+server-docs-name+}.

Direct Connection
`````````````````

To force operations to run on a specific node in a MongoDB replica set,
specify the connection information for the node in the connection string and
the ``directConnection`` parameter with a ``true`` value.

Direct connections include the following limitations:

- DNS seed list connection format connection strings cannot be used.
- Write operations fail when the specified host is not the primary.
- When the host is not the primary, you must specify the  ``secondary`` read
  preference in your connection options. To learn more about this limitation, see the
  :manual:`secondary read preference entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondary>`
  in the {+server-docs-name+}.

The following example shows the connection string you can add to your
Laravel application's ``.env`` file to establish a direct connection to a
secondary node in a MongoDB replica set. The example uses the following sample
values:

- ``host2`` as the hostname of the secondary node
- ``27017`` as the port on which the MongoDB node listens on

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Sample .env environment configuration to enable a direct connection

   DB_URI="mongodb://host2:27017/?directConnection=true&readPreference=secondary"
