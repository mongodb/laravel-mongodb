Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+odm-short+} to perform **find operations**
on your MongoDB collections. Find operations allow you to retrieve documents based on
criteria that you specify.

This guide shows you how to perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-matching`
- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-all`
- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-text-search`
- :ref:`Modify Find Operation Behavior <laravel-modify-find>`

Before You Get Started
----------------------

To run the code examples in this guide, complete the :ref:`Quick Start <laravel-quick-start>`
tutorial. This tutorial provides instructions on setting up a MongoDB Atlas instance with
sample data and creating the following files in your Laravel web application:

- ``Movie.php`` file, which contains a ``Movie`` model to represent documents in the ``movies``
  collection
- ``MovieController.php`` file, which contains a ``show()`` function to run database operations
- ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file, which contains HTML code to display the results of database
  operations

The following sections describe how to edit the files in your Laravel application to run
the find operation code examples and view the expected output.

.. _laravel-retrieve-matching:

Retrieve Documents that Match a Query
-------------------------------------

You can use Laravel's Eloquent object-relational mapper (ORM) to create models
that represent MongoDB collections and chain methods on them to specify
query criteria.

To retrieve documents that match a set of criteria, call the ``where()``
method on the collection's corresponding Eloquent model, then pass a query
filter to the method.

A query filter specifies field value requirements and instructs the find
operation to return only documents that meet these requirements.

You can use one of the following ``where()`` method calls to build a query:

- ``where('<field name>', <value>)`` builds a query that matches documents in
  which the target field has the exact specified value

- ``where('<field name>', '<comparison operator>', <value>)`` builds a query
  that matches documents in which the target field's value meets the comparison
  criteria

To apply multiple sets of criteria to the find operation, you can chain a series
of ``where()`` methods together.

After building your query by using the ``where()`` method, chain the ``get()``
method to retrieve the query results.

This example calls two ``where()`` methods on the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to
retrieve documents that meet the following criteria:

- ``year`` field has a value of ``2010``
- ``imdb.rating`` nested field has a value greater than ``8.5``

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                     $movies = Movie::where('year', 2010)
                         ->where('imdb.rating', '>', 8.5)
                         ->get();

                     return view('browse_movies', [
                         'movies' => $movies
                     ]);
                }
            }

To learn how to query by using the Laravel query builder instead of the
Eloquent ORM, see the :ref:`laravel-query-builder` page.

Match Array Field Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a query filter to match array field elements when
retrieving documents. If your documents contain an array field, you can
match documents based on if the value contains all or some specified
array elements.

You can use one of the following ``where()`` method calls to build a
query on an array field:

- ``where('<array field>', <array>)`` builds a query that matches documents in
  which the array field value is exactly the specified array

- ``where('<array field>', 'in', <array>)`` builds a query
  that matches documents in which the array field value contains one or
  more of the specified array elements

After building your query by using the ``where()`` method, chain the ``get()``
method to retrieve the query results.

Select from the following :guilabel:`Exact Array Match` and
:guilabel:`Element Match` tabs to view the query syntax for each pattern:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Exact Array Match
      :tabid: exact-array

      This example retrieves documents in which the ``countries`` array is
      exactly ``['Indonesia', 'Canada']``:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-exact-array
         :end-before: end-exact-array

   .. tab:: Element Match
      :tabid: element-match

      This example retrieves documents in which the ``countries`` array
      contains one of the values in the array ``['Canada', 'Egypt']``:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-elem-match
         :end-before: end-elem-match

To learn how to query array fields by using the Laravel query builder instead of the
Eloquent ORM, see the :ref:`laravel-query-builder-elemMatch` section in
the Query Builder guide.

.. _laravel-retrieve-all:

Retrieve All Documents in a Collection
--------------------------------------

You can retrieve all documents in a collection by omitting the query filter.
To return the documents, call the ``get()`` method on an Eloquent model that
represents your collection. Alternatively, you can use the ``get()`` method's
alias ``all()`` to perform the same operation.

Use the following syntax to run a find operation that matches all documents:

.. code-block:: php

   $movies = Movie::get();

.. warning::

   The ``movies`` collection in the Atlas sample dataset contains a large amount of data.
   Retrieving and displaying all documents in this collection might cause your web
   application to time out.

   To avoid this issue, specify a document limit by using the ``take()`` method. For
   more information about ``take()``, see the :ref:`laravel-modify-find` section of this
   guide.

.. _laravel-retrieve-text-search:

Search Text Fields
------------------

A text search retrieves documents that contain a **term** or a **phrase** in the
text-indexed fields. A term is a sequence of characters that excludes
whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence of terms with any number
of whitespace characters.

.. note::

   Before you can perform a text search, you must create a :manual:`text
   index </core/indexes/index-types/index-text/>` on
   the text-valued field. To learn more about creating
   indexes, see the :ref:`laravel-eloquent-indexes` section of the
   Schema Builder guide.

You can perform a text search by using the :manual:`$text
</reference/operator/query/text>` operator followed
by the ``$search`` field in your query filter that you pass to the
``where()`` method. The ``$text`` operator performs a text search on the
text-indexed fields. The ``$search`` field specifies the text to search for.

After building your query by using the ``where()`` method, chain the ``get()``
method to retrieve the query results.

This example calls the ``where()`` method on the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to
retrieve documents in which the ``plot`` field contains the phrase
``"love story"``. To perform this text search, the collection must have
a text index on the ``plot`` field.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-text
         :end-before: end-text

   .. tab:: Controller Method
      :tabid: controller

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                     $movies = Movie::where('$text', ['$search' => '"love story"'])
                         ->get();

                     return view('browse_movies', [
                         'movies' => $movies
                     ]);
                }
            }

         .. output::
            :language: none
            :visible: false

            ...

A text search assigns a numerical :manual:`text score </reference/operator/query/text/#text-score>` to indicate how closely
each result matches the string in your query filter. You can sort the
results by relevance by using the ``orderBy()`` method to sort on the
``textScore`` metadata field. You can access this metadata by using the
:manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` operator:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-text-relevance
   :end-before: end-text-relevance
   :emphasize-lines: 2

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``orderBy()`` method, see the
   :ref:`laravel-sort` section of this guide.

.. _laravel-modify-find:

Modify Behavior
---------------

You can modify the results of a find operation by chaining more methods
to ``where()``.

The following sections demonstrate how to modify the behavior of the ``where()``
method:

- :ref:`laravel-skip-limit` uses the ``skip()`` method to set the number of documents
  to skip and the ``take()`` method to set the total number of documents to return
- :ref:`laravel-sort` uses the ``orderBy()`` method to return query
  results in a specified order based on field values
- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-one` uses the ``first()`` method to return the first document
  that matches the query filter

.. _laravel-skip-limit:

Skip and Limit Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example queries for documents in which the ``year`` value is ``1999``.
The operation skips the first ``2`` matching documents and outputs a total of ``3``
documents.

.. _laravel-sort:

Sort Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To order query results based on the values of specified fields, use the ``where()`` method
followed by the ``orderBy()`` method.

You can set an **ascending** or **descending** sort direction on
results. By default, the ``orderBy()`` method sets an ascending sort on
the supplied field name, but you can explicitly specify an ascending
sort by passing ``"asc"`` as the second parameter. To
specify a descending sort, pass ``"desc"`` as the second parameter.

If your documents contain duplicate values in a specific field, you can
handle the tie by specifying more fields to sort on. This ensures consistent
results if the other fields contain unique values.

This example queries for documents in which the value of the ``countries`` field contains
``"Indonesia"`` and orders results first by an ascending sort on the
``year`` field, then a descending sort on the ``title`` field.

.. _laravel-retrieve-one:

Return the First Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the first document that matches a set of criteria, use the ``where()`` method
followed by the ``first()`` method.

Chain the ``orderBy()`` method to ``first()`` to get consistent results when you query on a unique
value. If you omit the ``orderBy()`` method, MongoDB returns the matching documents according to
the documents' natural order, or as they appear in the collection.

This example queries for documents in which the value of the ``runtime`` field is
``30`` and returns the first matching document according to the value of the ``_id``
field.
