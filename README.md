This package adds functionalities to the Eloquent model and Query builder for MongoDB, using the original Laravel API.
*This library extends the original Laravel classes, so it uses exactly the same methods.*

This package was renamed to `mongodb/laravel-mongodb` because of a transfer of ownership to MongoDB, Inc.
It is compatible with Laravel 10.x. For older versions of Laravel, please refer to the
[old versions](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility).

## Release Integrity

Releases are created automatically and the resulting release tag is signed using
the [PHP team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/php-driver.asc). To verify the
tag signature, download the key and import it using `gpg`:

```shell
gpg --import php-driver.asc
```

Then, in a local clone, verify the signature of a given tag (e.g. `4.4.0`):

```shell
git show --show-signature 4.4.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Composer does not support verifying signatures as part of its installation
> process.
